# Yield Liquidator

Flash-loan powered liquidator for fyDAI-ETH Yield Protocol positions, built in TypeScript.

Inspired by Georgios's [Yield-Liquidator](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yield-liquidator) in Rust.

**Highly unoptimized right now, working towards full functionality before optimization.**

## Todo

1. Collect positions for only new events
